The Rust hello world program although not a simple as some languages avoids verbosity.

<<hello.rs>>=
fn main() {
    print!("Hello, world");
}
@

It also benefits from an impressive build system cargo.

<<Cargo.toml>>=
[package]
name = "hello"
version = "0.1.0"
authors = ["Matt Champion <mattunderscorechampion@gmail.com>"]

[[bin]]
name = "hello"
