The Rust hello world program although not a simple as some languages avoids verbosity.

<<write to standard output>>=
println!("Hello, world");

<<entry point>>=
fn main() {
    <<write to standard output>>
}
<<hello.rs>>=
<<entry point>>
@ It also benefits from an impressive build system cargo.

<<Cargo.toml>>=
[package]
name = "hello"
version = "0.1.0"
authors = ["Matt Champion <mattunderscorechampion@gmail.com>"]

[[bin]]
name = "hello"
